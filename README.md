Week 1-2: Data Structures & Algorithms Basics
===
  Day 1-7: Review basics of data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps).
    Focus: Understand time complexity (Big O), memory usage, and when to use each structure.
    Practice: Solve easy to medium-level problems on arrays and linked lists.
    Resource: "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, LeetCode, HackerRank.
  Day 8-14: Start with basic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion).
    Focus: Implement and understand common algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, binary search.
    Practice: Solve problems involving sorting and searching on LeetCode.
    
Week 3-4: Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms
==
  Day 15-21: Dive into trees (binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, tries).
    Focus: Understand tree traversals, balancing trees, and common tree-based problems.
    Practice: Solve medium to hard-level tree problems.
  Day 22-28: Study graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms).
    Focus: Understand graph representations, traversals, and common graph algorithms.
    Practice: Work on problems involving graphs and dynamic programming.
    
Week 5-6: Problem-Solving & System Design
=
  Day 29-35: Focus on dynamic programming and backtracking.
    Focus: Practice problems that require these techniques, understand memoization.
    Practice: Work on medium to hard-level DP problems on LeetCode.
  Day 36-42: Introduction to system design (scalability, load balancing, distributed systems).
    Focus: Learn about system components, design patterns, and best practices.
    Practice: Design systems like URL shortener, chat applications, or online storage.
    
Week 7-8: Mock Interviews & Revision
=
  Day 43-49: Mock interviews and coding challenges.
    Focus: Simulate interview conditions with timed practice sessions.
    Practice: Use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io for mock interviews.
  Day 50-56: Revise weak areas and finalize system design knowledge.
    Focus: Review previously solved problems, revisit system design concepts.
    Practice: Take a full day to simulate an actual interview with coding and system design questions.
    
Additional Tips:
==============
Daily Routine: Spend 2 hours on coding problems, 1 hour on system design, and 1 hour revising or learning new concepts.
Weekend Focus: Use weekends for longer study sessions, mock interviews, and deeper dives into difficult topics.
Resources: LeetCode, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, "Elements of Programming Interviews" by Adnan Aziz.
This plan ensures a balanced approach, focusing on problem-solving skills and system design, essential for FAANG interviews.
